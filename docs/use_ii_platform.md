### Make sure reading following information before using II trading platform:

Why is the II trading platform developed?

> Because II trading involves the entire process of ICP transaction, seed phrase encryption, IC query, storage and other technologies. Generally speaking, going through these processes would have a lot of benefits for future development. That is why we build it first. But our future development direction is not limited to it. A lot more to expect from us.

Why use Plug for trading?

> First and foremost, We will never touch users asset, so we need an wallet solution to help with trading. Since the IC network is still in early stage, there are not many options to choose from. After many days of careful research and security analysis, we finally decided to use Plug for login and transaction. In this process, we will use safe and transparent methods to ensure the safety of user transactions.

 Why do I need to log in to Plug again every time I refresh?
> The Plug API requires authorization every time for security purpose.

Why is seed phrase blank sometimes?

> Due to encryption and decryption reasons, there may be a delay. Try refresh multiple times in the user center.

Why is there an prompt "This is not main device"?

> Do not use Plug in multiple places. In order to ensure the absolute security of the seed phrase, you need to use the device's browser to generate a public and private key to encrypt and decrypt the key, so only the browser that Plug uses for the first time can unlock the seed phrase. If you see this prompt, please use the browser you used for the first time to log in.

Which browser to use to log in to https://ii.dstar.app?
